## (draft) Context

Open Austin currently runs new member orientation and CANs concurrently.  From an "event organizing" perspective, this seems convenient.  However, this is a challenging experience for everyone involved:

* **Orientation lead:** Because the OA core team and overall product manager respresentation is miniscule, Liani is doubling as orientation lead and projects' individual contributor.
* **Project leads:** to come
* **Prospective new members:** to come

## Bets

If we decouple when CANs and new member orientation occur, then we'll lower burden on the OA core team.
If we create a welcome Slackbot, then new members will have a more scaffolded experience joining OA (which reduces the likeliness of drop-off)

## Development approach

We will develop the Slackbot in an iterative manner: We'll start with the most basic functionality that we think a new member needs, test it during new member orientations, and use those experiences to refine/develop further.

## (draft) Expected Slackbot behavior

MVP functionality - as a new member, I want to:
* See a full list of project channels so that I can take my time to choose which project to join
* Be prompted to introduce myself in #general

Potential future functionality:
* Link to Code of Conduct
* How to contribute to Open Austin
* More to come?
